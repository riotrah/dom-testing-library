Im this portentially redundant definitions it's the keys of the the `eventMap` objet, which I suspect serves as a better source of truth for `EventType`. Stlll, so as to not break anything that depended on the existing definition as distinct from its usage in parameters of `fireEvent`/`createEvent` (however un/common that might be), I've kept their defs distinct here.",
