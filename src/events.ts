  /**
   * Caveat: the type of `init` is tricky.
   * If in an environment that exposes an Event-extending class per Event type name in `window` or `globalThis`,
   * its type is that of the corresponding EventInit or EventInit-like interface.
   *
   * Eg: If:
   *
   * 1. Aforemention environmental conditions are met
   * 2. And eventName extends keyof typeof window (eg eventName === "MouseEvent", etc)
   * 3. Then init will/should be (at least partially) MouseEventInit, as determined by the 2nd argument for the MouseEvent constructor, etc
   *
   * However, if in an environment (eg IE11) where there does not exist such Event classes in window/globalThis, or if said property is not a Class,
   * `init` can be more correctly regarded as being of type Omit< MyEvent , 'bubbles' | 'cancelable' | 'detail' >,
   * where MyEvent is the actual Event derivative being created. That is, `init` is not so much an EventInit-like object so much as an Event-like one.
   * Technically, whatever `init` is, in the IE11 case, its properties will be merged with the Event that gets created, so it could have any shape,
   * including one that might violate any constraints that assumed the return of this function to be a "legal" DOM Event or derivative thereof.
   *
   * Given that the IE11 case is the edge case, I have defined `init` somewhat broadly, but with preference given to its type as being that of an EventInit-like object.
   *
   * In all cases, init may optionally define 'dataTransfer' and 'clipboardData' properties as well,
   * which are special cases for which the created Event object is explicity assigned as properties.
   * No attempt is made to verify whether those properties would reasonably exist on an Event of the created type.
   *
   * In addition, `init` may also define a `target` property and a `detail` property.
   *
   * `target`: should most probably take the shape of the same `node` that this Event is created against,
   * thus, eg. a click event's `target` prop should point to the element that was clicked on,
   * which should be the element passed as the first param to this function. However,
   * its usage implies the existence of a couple of optional properties - `files` and `value`,
   * whose types (taken from HTMLInputElement, their most likely containing object) I've explicitly intersected with their sole accesses below.
   *
   * `detail`: is only correctly used in the first case from the above-mentioned environmental Event class considerations, where it is passed to the event constructor.
   * In those cases its type is varied, and dependent on the Event in question.
   *
   * Part of their justification lies within usages of their types in this function, instances of which will be commented on inline.
   *
